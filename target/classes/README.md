Thank you for using EliteMobs!

This plugin is made to both work from the very start with no additional config work and to be highly customizable.

If you want to make some deep configuration changes to the plugin, try to read the GitHub wiki I've created ahead of time or as you're making the changes so you know what the options are doing. https://github.com/MagmaGuy/EliteMobs

If you need support with this plugin, you can reach me at my discord support channel: https://discord.gg/QSA2wgh

For all things EliteMobs related, you can go to my website to find all resources I've made available, such as the github page, the wiki, the custom loot maker, so on.

Hope you enjoy! If you do, leave rating on the resource page and / or buy me a coffee ! (paypal links can be found in the spigot resource page)
